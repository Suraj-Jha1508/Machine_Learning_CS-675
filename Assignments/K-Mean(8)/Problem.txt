Write a Python program to output a k-means clustering. Your program
would have similar structure to the nearest means program. Follow
the pseudocode given in the course slides. 

The input to your program is a dataset and number of cluster k.
The output is in the same format of label files we have been using
in the course. So if the clustering is C0 = {0, 2, 3}, C1 = {1, 4}
and C2 = {5} then the output would be

0 0
1 1
0 2
0 3
1 4
2 5

Submit your assignment by copying it into the directory
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/S19/cs/675/850/<ucid>.
For example if your ucid is abc12 then copy your Python program into 
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/S19/cs/675/850/abc12.

Your program is due before 11:30am on 11/25/19
